# elixir-bdd-w-devenv-gh-actions

A mostly vanilla repository, testing how to run cabbage tests with [phoenix](https://phoenixframework.org) using devenv gh actions template

## Errata

Presumably because I am using host bash I had to run `sudo locale-gen en_NZ.UTF-8` on the host OS (Ubuntu 24.04).
